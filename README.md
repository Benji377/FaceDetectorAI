# FaceDetectorAI
A small program coded in Python 3.9.0 which uses your webcam or standard video input to detect your face. Its not that efficient and/or reliable, but I still think it's a cool little project.

## Requirements:
To let it run you will need a computer or laptop with Windows on it and a video capture device which is already plugged in and set as standard video capture device.

## How it works:
You simply download the exe file and run it. It will automatically detect the standard video input and try to use it. If everything works you should see a window pop up on your screen where you see your video output. The program will then actively search for faces and draw blue rectangles around them. Its not very efficient or accurate, but it should just show the concept.
#### Important: To quit the app you can either press "Q" (suggested) or terminate the program
